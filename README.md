This project is a code implementation of my PhD research in physics. The project aims to advance our understanding of solar phenomena, specifically focusing on the dynamic processes underlying solar flares. The code is written in Python and is designed to be efficient, modular, and easy to extend. It leverages specialized numerical techniques to provide a powerful computational platform for modeling and simulating these events, contributing to the broader field of space weather research and astrophysics.

<summary><b>Setting Up a Virtual Environment for Linux</b></summary>

<br>
Follow these steps to set up a virtual environment for running the project:

1. **Create a working directory and navigate into it:**

    ```bash
    mkdir project-env && cd project-env
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv virtual-environment
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    source virtual-environment/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Verify that there are no packages installed running `pip list --local`:**

    ```bash
    (venv) user@your-machine:~/project-env$ pip list --local
    Package    Version
    ---------- -------
    pip        22.0.2
    setuptools 59.6.0
    ```

5. **Install the necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Verify that the required packages are installed:**

    ```bash
    pip list --local
    ```

Now your virtual environment is set up and ready to run the project. Enjoy coding!

Note: Make sure to replace `project-env` and `virtual-environment` with appropriate names for your project.
